### Problem Statement:

Given the description of the pizzas available, and the number of teams of 2, 3, or 4 people that have ordered, decide which pizzas to send to each of the teams.
The goal is to maximize, per team, the number of different ingredients used in all their pizzas.

### How we tackled the problem:

| Attempt | How to choose the teams? | How to choose the first pizza in a delivery? | How to choose the rest of the pizzas in the delivery? |
| :------ | :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| 1st | deliver to all the 4-person teams we have pizzas for, then to the 3-person teams and then to the 2-person teams | pick the one with the most ingredients | pick the one with the most ingredients |
| 2nd | deliver to all the 4-person teams we have pizzas for, then to the 3-person teams and then to the 2-person teams | pick the one with the most ingredients | pick the one with the most ingredients of the pizzas that have the least ingredients in common with the pizzas already selected for that delivery |
| 3rd | deliver to all the 4-person teams we have pizzas for, then to the 3-person teams and then to the 2-person teams | pick the one with the most ingredients | pick the one with the largest number of ingredients that weren't on any of the pizzas already selected for that delivery |
